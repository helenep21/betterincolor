Better In Color - Spotify API based website

You can test it here : https://helenep21.github.io/betterincolor

It's a simple website, made only with vanillaJS, HTML & CSS.
Using Spotify's API, it will get the album covers of your 5 most listened tracks of the month.
Those tracks will be displayed, and then used to create a 5 color palette (1 color for each track, the dominant tone of the cover).
